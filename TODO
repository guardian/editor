# Feature Development
* Remove event listeners, emit unbind to plugins so that can too
* Config for nesting elements


# Outstanding Patches
* Chrome and Firefox: Bold command uses B node instead of STRONG
* Chrome: Add a UL/OL, apply blockquote = nested UL/OLs (infinite)
  - User can recover by using backspace.


# To Investigate
* Buttons do not update the instance they are clicked. You have to start typing.


# Known Bugs
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE, add list, unapply blockquote = Creates BLOCKQUOTE
  without P.
* An item is pushed to the undo manager every time an empty editor is emptied.

# Bugs caused by Selection.placeMarkers
* Chrome: Insert list with at least 2 list items, <select all>, <backspace> =
  Creates two orphan list items
  - This is caused by Selection.placeMarkers adding a redundant text node after
    the inserted end marker.
* When applying the link command to an existing link, it does not clean up old
  A elements. This has been temporarily fixed by disabling the command when the
  selection contains an A element. (http://jsbin.com/AkasOzu/3/edit?html,js,console,output)
* When executing the remove format command, sometimes the selected inline
  elements remain. Related to the bug above (caused by inserting markers).
