# 2.0.0

A split text node will [no longer be replaced by a non-breaking backspace](https://github.com/guardian/scribe/pull/421) but instead should be a regular space character.

Thanks [Jeffrey Wear](https://github.com/wearhere) for this change/fix

# 1.4.15

Stripping of Chrome artifacts has been consolidated into a single function. Thanks [Regis Kuckaertz](https://github.com/regiskuckaertz)

# 1.4.14

The undo manager has been re-written to use Immutable data structures. Thanks [Regis Kuckaertz](https://github.com/regiskuckaertz)

# 1.4.13

A more elegant fix for [#401](https://github.com/guardian/scribe/issues/401) from [Alexy Golev](https://github.com/alexeygolev), thanks!

# 1.4.12

Restores `scribe.element` (lost in release 1.4.9) to avoid breaking backwards compatibility

# 1.4.11

Another attempt to fix [#401](https://github.com/guardian/scribe/issues/401), this time using Immutable data and Array.prototype.slice.

# 1.4.10

The `NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED` is now caught and supressed. This exeception is being [thrown by Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=562623) and seems to be a browser specific bug to do with element focus. This change just avoids lots of supurious errors being thrown.

We should remove it once the bug has been fixed.

# 1.4.9

Consolidates a number of api operations into the node module.

Restructing by [Regis Kuckaertz](https://github.com/regiskuckaertz)

# 1.4.8

Short-circuits the mutation evaluation via use of Array.prototype.some

[Regis Kuckaertz](https://github.com/regiskuckaertz)

# 1.4.7

Not a valid build, issues between Bower and NPM

# 1.4.6

Treat the clipboard data types variable as an array to avoid issues with future releases of Chrome (and other browsers). Resolves [#401](https://github.com/guardian/scribe/issues/401).

# 1.4.5

Corrects the NPM version of the ImmutableJS dependency

# 1.4.4

Replaces some of the use of Lodash contains with Immutable data structures and `includes`.

# 1.4.3

Changes the require alias so that the Immutable import path is simplified.

# 1.4.2

A number of performance improvements have been contributed by [Regis Kuckaertz](https://github.com/regiskuckaertz). Primarily these include avoiding TreeWalker where it isn't needed and moving a number of function definitions to the parse phase. See the individual PRs for details.

# 1.4.1

Small optimisation to avoid a relayout as a result of placing Scribe markers.

Thanks for improvement [Brad Vogel](https://github.com/bradvogel)

# 1.4.0

Changes the cleanup for Chrome inline style tags that happens in the patch for the `insertHTML` command. Previously span tags were aggressively stripped whereas now they are less aggressively removed to limit the fix just to the type of spans that Chrome inserts.

Thanks [Christopher Liu](https://github.com/christopherliu) for contributing this change.

# 1.3.9

Stops Scribe failing on a focus event if the content of the Scribe element is set to empty. Previously the code assumed that a child node is available, now the focus node will be the parent element if there are no children.

Based on contributions from [Ryan Fitzgerald](https://github.com/rf-)

# 1.3.7

Fixes a bug where em tags were being stripped where we meant to strip Scribe markers instead.

Thanks [Abdulrahman Alsaleh](https://github.com/aaalsaleh) for the fix

# 1.3.6

Fixes a bug preventing individual events being switched off events in the event-emitter
Bumps Lodash to 3.5.0 in the NPM package description for those using CommonJS builds

Thanks [Ryan Fitzgerald](https://github.com/rf-)!

# 1.3.5

Fixes `event-emitter` off behaviour when un-binding events

# 1.3.4

Reverts the change to 3.5.0 as Bower and NPM-based packagers were not behaving consistently.

# 1.3.3

All plugins, formatters and commands can now be overridden via options.

Thanks [David Tobin](https://github.com/DavidTobin)

Lodash has been bumped to 3.5.0

# 1.3.2

Option handling (defaults and overrides) have now been moved to their own module

# 1.3.1

Adds a null check to selection.js to help with issues when Scribe is being run in ShadowDOM. Thanks [Shaun Netherby](https://github.com/shaunnetherby)

# 1.3.0

Introduces a new time-based undo manager and improvements to allow multiple Scribe instances to share or have a separate undo manager. Thanks to [Abdulrahman Alsaleh](https://github.com/aaalsaleh) for providing the code and spending a lot of time working with us on the tests.

# 1.2.11

Added configuration for removing `scribe.undoManager`

# 1.2.10

Bugfixes for selections that are 'reversed' (i.e. selected from right to left) from [Deains](https://github.com/deains). Thanks

# 1.2.9

Clarifies the use of nodeName in the Command implementation. Thanks [Christopher Liu](https://github.com/christopherliu)

# 1.2.8

Event waterfall / [Event Namespacing](https://github.com/guardian/scribe/pull/337)

# 1.2.7

ShadowDOM fixes for Chrome from [ShaunNetherby](https://github.com/shaunnetherby), thanks

# 1.2.5

IE11 compatiability changes from [Deains](https://github.com/deains), thank you

# 1.2.4

Changes the way that root nodes are detected, the code now uses the element that the Scribe instance is bound to rather than looking for contenteditable attributes.

# 1.2.3

Changes the EventEmitter to store callbacks in sets to enforce uniqueness and avoid duplicate calls

# 1.2.1

Fixes a typo with the use of options in the default command patches that was breaking Browserify

# 1.2.0

Allows the default command patches to be over-ridden in the options. This will allow users to customise what gets loaded to address issues like [the behaviour of the bold patch](https://github.com/guardian/scribe/pull/250) where the default behaviour is not what is required.

# 1.1.0

Introduces [ImmutableJS](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js) (which is also exposed via scribe.immutable) and starts to convert some the internal workings of Scribe to use immutable data structures.

Adds 55K of needless bloat according to @theefer but I am heartless and laugh at his tears.

# 1.0.0

This is a non-backwards compatible change as we are removing the use of Scribe Common. The Node and Element apis that were available in that project are now exposed via the *scribe* object itself (`scribe.node` and `scribe.element`).

Existing plugins should not break for this release but please re-write your plugins if you use 1.0.0 as a dependency.
